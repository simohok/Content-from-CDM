Process specific data from Common Data Model

This file reads Microsoft CDM zip from (https://github.com/microsoft/CDM for different analyze purposes (zip-file downloaded from Github @ 12/2020). If and when further analysis from JSON-files is needed; for example, Power BI Desktop, then both potential entities (files ending in cdm.json that do not include manifest.cdm.json files) and their relationships (files ending in manifest.cdm.json) files) are finally extracted into two directories - one for potential entities and one for relationships. Comments are in Finnish.
